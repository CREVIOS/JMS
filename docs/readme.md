## Introduction
The Article Management Version Version 4 marks the third release of important system for managing submitted articles.

## Technical Summery
This version is mostly written in Javascript. The app is built on top of NodeJS. On the front end, we are using HTML, CSS and Javascript, we also used a framework called Bootstrap (specificlly a tool, called Bootstrap Studio, free through Github Student Pack). On the backend and API, we are using a Node framework called Express, this was used to create the server we used. For the database we used Google Firebase (the Firestore and Authentication tools). The app is hosted on Heroku.
